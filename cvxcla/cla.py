    This class implements the Critical Line Algorithm as described by Harry Markowitz

    The algorithm starts with the first turning point (the portfolio with the highest
    expected return) and then iteratively computes the next turning point with a lower
    expected return until it reaches the minimum variance portfolio.

    Attributes:
        mean: Vector of expected returns for each asset.
        covariance: Covariance matrix of asset returns.
        lower_bounds: Vector of lower bounds for asset weights.
        upper_bounds: Vector of upper bounds for asset weights.
        A: Matrix for linear equality constraints (Ax = b).
        b: Vector for linear equality constraints (Ax = b).

    turning point associated with the highest expected return, and then
    compute the sequence of turning points, each with a lower expected
    return than the previous.That first turning point consists in the
    smallest subset of assets with highest return such that the sum of
    their upper boundaries equals or exceeds one.

    We sort the expected returns in descending order.
    This gives us a sequence for searching for the
    first free asset. All weights are initially set to their lower bounds,
    and following the sequence from the previous step, we move those
    weights from the lower to the upper bound until the sum of weights
    exceeds one. If possible the last iterated weight is then reduced
    to comply with the constraint that the sum of weights equals one.
    This last weight is the first free asset,
    and the resulting vector of weights the first turning point.

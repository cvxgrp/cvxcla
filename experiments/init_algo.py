"""Initial Algorithm Comparison Experiment.

This script compares two different implementations of the algorithm for finding
the first turning point in the Critical Line Algorithm (CLA) for portfolio optimization:
1. init_algo: The standard implementation
2. init_algo_lp: An implementation using linear programming

Both algorithms compute the first turning point on the efficient frontier,
which is the portfolio with the highest expected return that satisfies the constraints.

The experiment uses a large-scale problem with 10,000 assets, all having the same
expected return and the same bounds, to test the performance and behavior of both implementations.
